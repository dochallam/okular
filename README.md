# Configuration for Okcular PDF viewer
After installing the `okcular` package, download these files into local directory `~/.confg`

**Don't clone the repository, since that will create a `.git` directory and turn the
entire `~/.config` directory into a repository, which is not what we want.**

This will create two files in `~/.config`:

- `okularrc`
- `okularpartrc`
